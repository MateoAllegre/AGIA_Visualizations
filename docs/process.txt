Export as .glb, LOD 50% (otherwise too heavy for Blender, just crashes on import)
Open a new General Blender scene, delete everything (A X Enter)
Import the .glb
Rotate it -90° along the x axis (R X -90 Enter)
Center the object: F3 > Origin to Geometry, then clear the transform with Alt-G
Save the .blend
Export the "bigger" version by going Export > .glb (Activate Compression)
(Optional): If some parts of the model need to be preserved, select them, Invert selection and create a Vertex Group
Apply a Decimate modifier (on the V.G. defined in previous step if any, or on the full model), decimate by 0.5
Export again, make sure to check "Apply Modifiers" and uncheck Compression
The model needs to be under about 200MB. Adjust decimation factor and re-export if needed.
Once satisfied with the uncompressed filesize, re-export with compression. The result is the light version.
